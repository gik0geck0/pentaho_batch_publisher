pentaho_batch_publisher
=======================

Ruby program that can interface with a pentaho bi-server, and can batch-publish reports to one or more servers

Deprication of Python:
    For internal-work use, the python-development has been dropped in favor of Ruby (since we have an internal gem repository).
    The python files remain since they represent how the port would look/feel, but aren't close at all to the end-result.

Ideas:
    Keep record of who publishes what report where
